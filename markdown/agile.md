### 4. Agile Programming and Sprints

Agile programming is focused on results, combining responsive collaborative people with demonstrable, concrete goals (usually software, but in our case, the demos). It builds in an environment that uses collaboration and feedback to produce constant improvement and development of outputs. See <http://agilemanifesto.org/> for more information about agile programming. 

Cybera has considerable expertise in this domain, and will take the lead in guiding teams through this process. A key tool is the **sprint** where "bite-size" projects are set, and undertaken to completion in a two-week cycle.

We will be using the Jira software tool to manage these processes. <https://jira.cybera.ca>
