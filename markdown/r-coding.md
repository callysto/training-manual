### 12. R coding

I don't use R, so I don't have much to say. 

My impression is that everything you can do in R can also be done very well in Python. Also, Python is a very good general purpose prpgramming language, so there is a lot you can do in Python that you cannot do in R. In particular, Python is great for doing impressive graphics and animations. Python is also said to be easier to learn. 

So let's stick to Python for now.

But, if there are packages you really want to use, that only run in R, you can read more about the language here: <https://www.r-project.org/>
