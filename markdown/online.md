#### The Callysto server:
You can create and run your Jupyter notebooks using the callysto server that is maintained by Cybera and PIMS. Just click here:

[https://hub.callysto.ca](https://hub.callysto.ca)

Log in using your Google ID. Note you should stick to one ID, as each instance of an ID will give you a separate server, with separate file storage. Usually you want to keep all your code in one place, so use only one ID.

#### The Callysto github repo:
This is where we post our public demos, notebooks, etc.

#### The private Callysto github repo:
This is where we post our private demos, for discussion and improvement before release.
