# Process for bug reporting - Have you tried turning it off and on again?

## Who can report a bug?

### Internal 
* Cybera & PIMS

### External
* Callysto creator (content creator / curriculum expert - professor, teachers etc)
* Callysto developer (Student developers)
* End users - Students, Teachers

## Where can they report a bug?

* Internal bug tracking - JIRA
* External bug tracking - Email? We should probably get a new email id specifically for reporting bugs related to Callysto.

JIRA can be setup to automatically create issues or comments on existing issues from messages received to a particular email address.

More on how to do this here: https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver071/creating-issues-and-comments-from-email-802592933.html

## How to report a bug?

* Three important aspects of bug reporting in general are:
    * Brief description of the bug, with steps on how to reproduce it.
    * Expected result
    * Actual result 
* When writing down the steps to reproduce a bug,
    *  It would be helpful to note down the environment details like web browser or other system information if thats relevant. Also, note down general details like name of the notebook, section of the notebook where you find the error, etc.
    * Add screenshots if possible and only if it adds to the explanation.

## Questions to discuss further:
* How do we go about reporting errors in the content of the notebook? Should we report them as bugs?
* If all these issues end up in JIRA who are the owners for these issues? Cyberans? PIMS? or the student developers?
* If student developers are responsible to respond to these bug reports, will they get access to JIRA as well?
