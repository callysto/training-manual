### 8. Jupyter Hub

You get to the Hub by logging into the <https://hub.callysto.ca> service using your Google ID  and clicking the button to “Start My Server.”

The Hub is a page that lists all your files and folders. It looks like this:

As you can see, the Hub looks a lot like the list of files and folders you would see in the Finder on MacOS, or in the File Explorer in Windows.

At the top right corner of this front page is a “Control Panel” that lets you access your Jupyter server, to turn it on or off. Also is the logout button, to end your session.

The main body is the list of folders and files that you have on your server.

Click on a file or folder to open it. Use the checkbox on the left to select a file, then do something with it. For instance, you can choose to rename it, copy it, stop it from running, or delete it.

It is a good idea to create folders at the top level, to organize your work into usable spaces. It turns out it is hard to move a file once it is created. (More on this below.) So you should start by organizing your folders and files at the top level.

Near the top right, you see the upload button, which allows you to upload a file from your computer onto the Jupyter Hub. You can upload any file, including any data files or image files you might wish to analyse.

Also near the top right is the “New” button, which allows you to create a new folder or file. You can make text files, notebook files in Python, or R, or open a Unix terminal window.

THIS SECTION NEEDS TO BE UPDATED. We can use this tree form, or we can use Jupyter Lab. In many ways, I prefer Jupyter Lab and the Jupyter team seems to be developing this method the most. On the other hand, code runs differently in the two regimes (for instance, Lab tries to strip out some Javascript and can mess up your plots), so you need to be careful.
