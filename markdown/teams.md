### 3. Team Structure

We envision teams of 2 to 6 people, consisting of a teacher (K-12) as a curriculum expert and content creator, a university professor who can assist in the content and in the supervision of the students, and 1 to 4 student developers who are (or will become) Jupyter experts, and will be doing much of the coding, writing, and testing of the demos under the direction of the teacher and professor. 

We may have something like specific titles as “Callysto Creator” and “Callysto Developer.” The goal of both is the same: to create demos for use by teachers and students in K-12 classes that demonstrate the use of Jupyter notebooks integrated into the course curriculum. The demos will cover a variety of topics in math, science, social science, humanities and so forth. The demos may be used at conferences and workshops to show off the technology to teachers and school administrators, as well as being prepared for use in the classroom.

At Stage 1, developer teams will be based at PIMS universities (for funding reasons), and report to the PIMS Site Directors and the Coordinator, Michael Lamoureux. The overall project manager is Byron Chu at Cybera, who will coordinate the all the acitivity of the Creators and Developers. 

Callysto Developers, the students,  will be writing code, mainly in Python on Jupyter notebooks, but also wrangling HTML code, eBook sources, Pandas for data analysis, and more, with the above stated goal of creating high quality demos. They will be  reporting to a professor or instructor at the PIMS university, work closely with the Creators (K-12 teacher) on the team who will be suggesting curriculum topics to develop. Both Creators and Developers will use their own initiative and creativity to come up with exciting and innovative way to showcase the abilities of Jupyter in the K-12 context.

Teams may also bring in experts from other places (eg Oceans researcher, Earth Sciences researchers) to use their work as source material for these demos. Collaboration with these groups will be done under the continuing direction of your team leader. 

Personnel will need to track and record of their work hours, in order for us to track budgets and operations. Note there are constraints on the amount of time students can be working, as well as constraints on the K-12 teachers because of contracts and/or union rules.
