### 6. Software tools - Roll your own


*"Roll your own"* as in *"Roll your own cigarettes"* means as developers, we might prefer to do it all ourselves, as bright individuals who know what we want. 

The advantages of choosing our own software tools include:

- we can use the tools we think are best, or most familiar to us
- we can maintain our own system, not relying on an IT team
- we can run independent of the internet, not worried about connectivity
- we can choose tools that have more capabilities that the team's tools.

Some disadvantages include:

- our choice might not be compatible with the rest of the team
- our choice might not run in the finished project (eg. on the Callysto server)
- we have to do all the maintenance and conversions ourselves.

Nevertheless, if you want to roll your own, here are some choices that will help keep you consistent with the team.

#### Jupyter tree or lab:
You have a choice of running the Jupyter notebooks in the old *tree* format, or the newer *lab* format. Change the browser address from
```
https://hub.callysto.ca/jupyter/user/username/tree?
to
https://hub.callysto.ca/jupyter/user/username/lab?
```
or vice versa. We prefer you use Jupyter tree, Jupyter lab is still in beta and it is not fully compatible with Jupyter tree.

#### Programming language:
Callysto hub comes with Python and R. For consistency across teams, our development will mainly be in Python 3 and we will not use the R kernel.
