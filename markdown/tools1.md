### 5. Software tools - Eat your own dogfood

"Eat your own dogfood" means that, as developers, we should be using the same tools we are developing for our clients. (The slogan originates with Microsoft.) 

The tools we want teachers and students to use are:

- Jupyter notebooks, accessed on the [hub](https://hub.callysto.ca/)
- with Python, Markdown, and HTML/Javascript for coding

The advantages of using our our own tools are manifold:

- the content you write will work as expected for the clients
- the performance you see will be the same for the client
- the developer teams will have a uniform environment to create in
- the IT team has only one uniform plaform to maintain for many teams

Some disadvantages include:

- developers need constant, high quality internet access
- the IT teams needs to keep the server up and running with high reliability (please report server bugs!)
- some of the cool things you can do on your own laptop may break on the server-client model
- we want to limit imports of obscure external libraries, which limits what we can do
- less opportunity to customize your Jupyter experience
