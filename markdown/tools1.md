### 5. Software tools - Eat your own dogfood

"Eat your own dogfood" means that, as developers, we should be using the same tools that we are developing for our clients. (The slogan originates with Microsoft.) 

The tools we want teachers and students to use are:

- Jupyter notebooks
- accessed over a remote server on the web
- with Python, Markdown, and html/javascript for coding and presentaion
- and repositories on Github.

The advantages of using our our own tools are manifold:

- the content your write will work as expected for the clients
- the performance you see will be the same for the client
- the developer teams will have a uniform environment to create in
- the IT team has only one uniform plaform to maintain for the many teams.

Some disadvantages include:

- developers need constant, high quality internet access
- the IT teams needs to keep the server up and running with high reliability
- some of the cool things you can do on your own laptop may break on the server-client model.
